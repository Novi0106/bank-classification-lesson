## Problem statement
Our bank data bank gives us an overview over transactions of a Czech bank in the 90s, including the status of loans i.e. if they are good or bad.

We want to understans whether with the available data we can confidently predict if a new customer will fall into the bad loan bucket.

## Data

We will be using the bank dataset provided in the beginning of week 3.

## Approach
In this repository you will find access to a jupyter notebook file that will walk you through the necessary steps to answer the problem statement through the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Importing relevant libraries</li>
  <li>Connecting to SQL & creating a dataframe</li>
  <li>Exploring the data initially (EDA)</li>
  <li>Identifying cleaning steps for the data</li>
  <li>Conducting pre-processing</li>
  <li>Conducting train test splitting</li>
  <li>Evaluating the accuracy of our model</li>
</ol>

Hoepefully you'll be able to learn a thing or two. I certainly did. Enjoy!
